## 1. Introduction

Based on the paper "Unfolding the Structure of a Document using Deep Learning" ([Rahman and Finin, 2019](research.md#Rahman)), this software project attempts to automatically recognize the structure in arbitrary PDF documents and thus make them more searchable in a more qualified manner.
Documents not in PDF format are converted to PDF format using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). 
Documents based on scanning which, therefore, do not contain text elements, are scanned and converted to PDF format using the [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) software. 
This process applies to all image format files e.g. jpeg, tiff etc., as well as scanned images in PDF format.
