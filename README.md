Based on the paper "Unfolding the Structure of a Document using Deep Learning" (**[Rahman and Finin, 2019](docs/research.md#Rahman)**), this software project attempts to automatically recognize the structure in arbitrary PDF documents and thus make them more searchable in a more qualified manner.
Documents not in PDF format are converted to PDF format using **[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)**.
Documents based on scanning which, therefore, do not contain text elements, are scanned and converted to PDF format using the **[Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)** software.
This process applies to all image format files e.g. jpeg, tiff etc., as well as scanned images in PDF format.

Please see the **[Documentation](https://konnexionsgmbh.github.io/dcr/)** for more detailed information.
